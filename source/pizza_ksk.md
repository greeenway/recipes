## Ingredients (for 4 pizzas)

550g + (a bit) flour
330ml water (body temperature)
16g salt
2g yeast
a pinch of sugar (optional)
a "shot" of milk (optional)
a bit of olive oil

~500ml of tomatoe sauce
2 balls of mozarella cheese
+ whatever topings you like


## Steps:

1. put 550g flour into a bowl
2. make a hole in the middle (~fist size)
3. poor water into the hole
4. put yeast into the water
5. (optional) put sugar and milk into the water
6. stir the water/yeast/... with a spoon
7. cover the water/yeast/... with a bit of the flour in the bowl
8. wait 30min, at room temperature
9. mix everything together and add salt
10. push this dough for around 30min by hand or with a fancy cooking machine
11. it is done when it can be pulled apart a bit and doesn't tear apart
12. form dough to a ball and rub olive oil around it
13. put the dough ball into the bowl, cover it with a kitchen towel
14. leave it in the fridge for one night
15. jump to 19. if you want pizza sooner but less awesome
16. put a bit of olive oil around the dough for it not to get dry
17. put the dough into some small container and leave it in the fridge
18. wait 1-2 days (more waiting -> more bubbles/fluffier dough)
19. take dough out of the fridge 1 hour before making the pizza
20. cut dough in 4 ports and form smaller balls
20. put a baking plate into the ofen on the second to highest level
21. preheat the ofen to maximum temperature from above(!) for example "grill"
22. take a coated pan and cover the pan with a bit of flower
23. put one ball into the pan and stretch it with your hands
24. you can form a "crust" with your hands if your talented or just wrap in the edges
25. brush some olive oil onto the edges/crust
26. start heating the pan on medium heat (I use 7 of 9)
27. prepare all other topings and wait until the dough stops sticking to the pan
28. now add tomatoe sauce (always take a bit less than you think you should)
29. add slices of mozarella 
30. add other ingredients
31. when the bottom of the pizza starts getting brown turn of the heat
32. take the pizza out of the pan and put it on the baking plate 
   (with a pizza spatula or two flippers and a bit of practice. t
    this is the only part that needs some skill in the whole recipe)
33. wait for the pizza to bake (takes ~4 minutes at 300Â°C for me)
34. when the pizza looks done use flippers/splatula to get your pizza out of the ofen
35. eat pizza


## Time Needed

5min make dough
30min dough pushing
2*2min oiling dough
2.5days of waiting
20-30 min to form/bake pizza


## Comments

For tomatoe sauce: the guy in the video uses raw tomatoe sauce, i put 3 garlic cloves into a pan with olive oil and then after roasting them add 500ml of tomatoe sauce and some salt, basil and oregano and cook it for 2h
